 i have two similar documents which were photographed under very similar, yet not exactly the same lighting conditions. a color standard with 6 primary colors, white, dark gray and black. and a gray scale standard with 19 graduations were included in each photograph. using only the color standards as reference to infer differences in lighting conditions, propose a method for developing an algorithm that when applied to the 1st image would cause it to appear as if it was photographed in the same lighting conditions as the 2nd image.
